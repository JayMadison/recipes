Ingredients
1 large Onion (diced)
1 large Red Bell Pepper (diced)
1 large Green Bell Pepper (diced)
3-4 cloves Garlic (minced)
1 splash Vegetable Broth (for sautéing)
8 oz Your Choice of Meat Substitutes OR
1/2 cup Bulgur Wheat, uncooked (optional)
1 can Tomato Sauce (no salt added) (8oz)
1 can Diced Tomatoes - Fire Roasted, RoTel, etc (15oz)
2 cups Vegetable Broth (low sodium)
1/2 can Refried Beans (no fat) (15 oz can)
1/4 cup Chili Powder (yes...1/4 CUP)
2 tsp Ground Cumin
1 tsp Paprika
1 tsp Oregano
1 tsp Chipotle Chili Powder (optional)
1 can Pinto Beans (los sodium) (15oz can - drained & rinsed)
1 can Kidney Beans (50% less sodium - not drained)
1/2 tsp Black Pepper
1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
2 Tbs Pickled Jalapeños (with juice) (again, adds a little heat so adjust accordingly)
1-2 Tbs Masa Harina Tamale Flour (if necessary to thicken)
Instructions
Chop onions and peppers into a large soup pot
Saute in a little veggie broth until translucent and softened.
Add minced garlic and saute for an additional 30 seconds until fragrant
Add any kind of meat substitute (if using) or dry, uncooked bulgur and continue to stir for a few minutes until heated through
Add tomatoes, tomato sauce, and remaining broth
Add in spices and stir until mixed well
Add all the beans and jalapeños and stir
Sprinkle up to 1-2 Tbs of the Masa on top if you think it needs thickening.  The masa adds a slight 'corn tortilla' or 'tamale' flavor to the chili. 
Give the chili one more good stir and bring it to a slow boil.
Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15 to 30 minutes.
